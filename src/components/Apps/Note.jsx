            <p>Hello! I&apos;m Eli, and I&apos;m Front-end Developer.ðŸª„</p>
            <p>
              My toolkit primarily includes React and Next.js, which I use to
              build dynamic applications that perform seamlessly. Writing code
              that is both maintainable and efficient is essential to my work,
              and I am always eager to learn new techniques and improve my
              problem-solving skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have a curious mindset I love experimenting with new tools,
              keeping up with the latest trends in web development, and
              continuously refining my skills.
            </p>
            <p>
